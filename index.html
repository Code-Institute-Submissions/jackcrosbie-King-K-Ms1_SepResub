                    Ronan has been involved in music for as long as he can remember. He has been the drummer for King K longer then he wishes to remember. <hr> A multi-instrumentalist who when not playing the drums or in his recording studio can be found cutting crystal in Kinsale Crystal.

                    Ben Dillon has a cool dog. His dog is named Dexter. He's the best. Ben sometimes plays guitar and sings but he's not as cool as his dog. <hr> I wish his dog was the lead singer of King K. He's a really really cool dog. Like the best dog. Just sayin'
